./run.sh -n 1 -o ./generated_images "A lone astronaut in a worn NASA EVA suit stands on the rust-red dunes of Valles Marineris at dawn. The sun crests behind Phobos, casting dual shadows. Ultra-fine dust swirls in golden light beams. Olympus Mons looms violet in the distance. Cinematic anamorphic lens flare, 85mm prime, f/1.4, Kodak Vision3 250D color grade, grain texture, NASA archival realism."

./run.sh -n 1 -o ./generated_images "An endless spiral library floating in a nebula-void. Bookshelves made of liquid mercury twist into Möbius strips. Each book glows with trapped starlight; pages turn themselves, revealing fractal galaxies. A Victorian librarian made of stained glass reads silently. Octane render, ray-traced caustics, 32k micro-detail, golden ratio composition, metaphysical realism."

./run.sh -n 1 -o ./generated_images "A young monk in neon-orange robes kneels in a torrential cyberpunk rain, praying over a dying street samurai. Holographic lotus flowers bloom in puddles. Towering megacorp billboards flicker in kanji. Steam rises from ramen stalls. Blade Runner 2049 color palette, shallow depth of field, 50mm lens, rain droplets in focus, melancholic realism."

./run.sh -n 1 -o ./generated_images "A colossal translucent whale drifts through an abyssal trench. Its body is a living galaxy—nebulae of glowing plankton pulse inside. Ancient shipwrecks orbit like moons. Tendrils of light trail 100 meters. National Geographic cover style, 8k macro clarity, volumetric god rays, deep-sea color grading, ethereal silence."

./run.sh -n 1 -o ./generated_images "A overgrown Renaissance cathedral reclaimed by nature. Sunlight pierces stained glass, illuminating a young inventor building a solar-powered ornithopter from salvaged marble angels. Vines weave through Da Vinci sketches on the floor. Cinematic golden hour, Alphonse Mucha + Mad Max aesthetic, 14th-century detail meets 22nd-century hope."
